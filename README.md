> Start Flarum in the PHP development server.

## 📢 Important information

- It is not an extension, so it does not display on the extension page.
- Works immediately after installation (similar to `plug&play`).
- You can set port and custom domain. For this purpose, use the arguments - `--host` and `-p, --port` (see screenshots).

## 🚀 Installation

To download the ~~extension~~ _tool_ you can ~~use [Bazaar](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/5151-flagrow-bazaar-the-extension-marketplace)~~ ~~or~~ _only_ install it through composer:

## 👋 A few words from me

Again, I would like to thank [@clarkwinkelmann](https://discuss.flarum.org/u/clarkwinkelmann) for directing the concept of execution - not creating an extension to flarum, but a simple package. It gave me an effect similar to the `plug&play` I wanted to get from the beginning. Why again? Because with the previous extension he also helped me. I literally love you, [@clarkwinkelmann](https://discuss.flarum.org/u/clarkwinkelmann).

The extension is aimed at developers and individuals who do not have apache or nginx installed. With one command you can display the forum locally. If necessary, you can change the port and domain to a different one than the `localhost`.
